SaltMine Conventions
====================

+ SRY - Stop Repeating Yourself!
+ Abstract Appropriately and Often
+ Don't Break Compatibility
+ Intelligent defaults.
+ Minimize assumptions. Verify everything.
+ Base templating language is mako

### Naming `Named` Keys:
All elements must use named and unique keys to enable easy extension.

+ Key types: (pkg, service, file, pillar, states)
+ pkg: `tomcat7-pkg`, `haproxy-pkg`
+ service: `tomcat7-service`, `haproxy-service`
+ file: `haproxy-cfg`, `motd-file` ( Include file extension in name if exists ``[filename]-[extension]``, else use ``[filename]-file`` )
+ pillar: `saltmine_+[variablename]`
+ states: `[statename]/descriptivename.sls`

### Files and Directories:

+ Template files have a file extension with the template language name: ``motd.mako``
+ All sls files explicitly state the file type with the appropriate shebang at the top: ``#!yaml`` or ``#!mako|yaml``
+ Pillar variables stored in ``saltmine/pillar/env_globals.sls``
+ Files stored in ``saltmine/files/[statename]/[filename]``. Filename separators use underscores. Example: ``saltmine/files/haproxy/haproxy_logrotate``

### Map Files:

+ Include salt-cloud maps and profiles in named directories in ``saltmine/maps/``

### Pkg Files:

+ pkg files should be in named files that correspond to the commonly accepted program name, and not the package name. e.g. ``saltmine/pkgs/pip.sls`` instead of ``saltmine/pkgs/python-pip.sls``
+ ``saltmine/pkg/`` files should install the latest program version by default. 
+ pkg sls files should allow to install a specific version by setting a global variable in your pillar file. e.g. for boto, the pillar variable would be ``saltmine_boto_version``

### Services:

+ All services are given default states of ``running`` and ``enable: True``. Included services must be explicitly disabled and stopped in your state files.
+ Services are set to require the appropriate installation states
+ The service itself should not have a ``watch: file`` parameter. This is not very maintainable.

### Pillar Variables:

+ All saltmine pillar variables begin with ``saltmine_``. E.g. ``saltmine_boto_version``
+ Use simple `key: value` pairs only for easy extensibility. E.g. ``saltmine_boto_version: '2.7.0'``

### States:

+ states should be included in named directories in ``saltmine/states/``
+ Default config files are set up in the init.sls file in the states directory 
+ Use ``watch_in`` and ``require_in``, etc. to modify the service that the state file depends on. 


Use this:

```yaml
# saltmine/service/haproxy.sls
haproxy-service:
  service:
    - dead
    - name: haproxy
    - enable: 
      - false
    - require:
      - pkg: haproxy-pkg

# saltmine/states/haproxy/init.sls
haproxy-cfg:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
    - watch_in:
      - service: haproxy-service
```

with usage like this:

```yaml
include:
  - saltmine.states.haproxy

extend:
  haproxy-service:
    service:
      - running
      - enable:
        - true
```

Instead of:

```yaml
haproxy:
  service:
    - running
    - enable: 
      - true
    - watch:
      - file: /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
    - require:
      - pkg: haproxy
```

### TBI (To be implemented)

+ state testing standards
